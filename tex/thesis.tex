The human brain functions to regulate our bodies' organs and tissues as well as
govern complex behaviors such as cognition and sensation \cite{Kandel2012}. The
brain's key cell type, the neuron, functions to communicate with other neurons
via specialized subcellular sites called synapses. Neurons are organized into
complex networks or circuits that support the computations that form our
thoughts, reflexes, and sensations. At the molecular level, these interactions
are supported by the function of proteins--the 'molecular machinery' of the cell
(Figure \ref{fig:goodsell}).  Proteins are organized into interacting complexes
and larger communities of interacting proteins that co-localize at membrane and
non-membrane enclosed subcellular sites, like the synapse, where they function
together to perform cellular work \cite{Alberts2008}. Complex
networks of protein and cellular interactions define the human tissues that
sustain life.

\subsection{Referencing labels}

You can create labels with the \texttt{label} command. Then point to that part
of the document with \texttt{autoref}. For example, "In \autoref{chap:02}, I discuss methods
for testing for differential abundance in protein proteomics experiments."

\section{Equations}

Statistical testing in proteomics is usually done for each protein-level subset
of the data. The simplest model includes a single fixed-effect term,
Condition which represents experimental treatment groups such as
Genotype (e.g. WT versus Mutant) or Treatment (e.g. BioID versus Control).
Consider the following linear model, given in matrix form, which is fit to the
data from a single protein:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:lm}
	Y_{p} = X\beta_{p} + \epsilon_{p} % Y = XB + e
\end{equation}

$Y_{p}$ is a vector of $log_{2}$ intensity for protein $p$. The matrix $X$
stores information about the experiment's fixed-effect covariate,
Condition.  $\beta_{p}$ is a vector of regression coefficients,
obtained from the fit model.  We also estimate $\epsilon_{p}$ which quantifies
any residual error and by definition is normally and independently distributed:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:error}
	\epsilon_{p} \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2) % e = N(0,s2)
\end{equation}

Linear, fixed-effect models can be extended to include additional mixed-effects
to provide a description of more complex sources of variation in an experimental
design \cite{Bates2015}:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
		\label{eq:lmer}
		Y_{p} =  Z\alpha_{p} + X\beta_{p} + \epsilon_{p} \\
		\alpha_{p} \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma_{Z}^2) \\
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The mixed-effect term, $Z\alpha_{p}$, includes $Z$, a matrix of mixed-effects.
The parameter $\alpha_{p}$ quantifies error among these mixed-effects (also
called random effects).  By definition, the random-effect error is independently
and normally distributed (Equation \ref{eq:lmer}). Using linear mixed-models we
can untangle variance attributed to a biological effect of interest from other
sources of variation which mask this response.


\section{Example Table}

		\hline
		A & 74 & 122\\

		C & 85 & 153\\
		D & 88 & 88\\
